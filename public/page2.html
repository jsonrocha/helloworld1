      <span class="white purplebg leftmarg">2018 has seen techno music only increase in popularity.  With so many subgenres growing from the broad Electronic Music description, there is no telling the actual limit to how much this genre could continue to expand.  Judging by history, Europe may hold the answer.  If Europe was the original adopter of this music, before it gained influence in the U.S., one could assume that they will also be the trendsetter in terms of the genre's eventual decline.
