      <span class="white leftmarg">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always enjoyed making music. What once was a passion for playing guitar and drums; creating rock music has grown into a love for all things electronic and specifically for recording house and techno music. There are many more layers to this
        more modern genre. Between the bass, drum track, synthesizers and vocals, one can easily get lost or confused during the recording process. However, once put together, the tracks become one cohesive harmony of digital tones and beats that can
        quickly turn any room into a dancefloor.  Couple this music with some stage presence and laser lights and it makes for an amazing spectacle.

      <span class="white leftmarg">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also a very convenient hobby. Any coding activity can easily be compared to the recording process for techno or electronic music in general. Like coding, hour-long masterpieces can be created from a desk chair with nothing but a laptop and a MIDI keyboard.
        This makes the process extremely comfortable accessible to artists from all different types of backgrounds and environments. This also simplifies the often complicated process of project sharing or long-distance collaboration.  Electronic music seems to be ever-evolving and will carry the music world into the future for years to come.
