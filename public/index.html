       ABOUT FAVORITE HOBBY-->
  <section>
    <div>I have always enjoyed making music. What once was a passion for playing
    guitar and drums; creating rock music has grown into a love for all things
    electronic and specifically for recording house and techno music.  There are
    many more layers to this more modern genre.  Between the bass, drum track,
    synthesizers and vocals, one can easily get lost or confused during the
    recording process.  However, once put together, the tracks become one cohesive
    harmony of digital tones and beats that can quickly turn any room into a
    dancefloor.</div>

    <div>This is also a very convenient hobby.  Any coding activity can easily
    be compared to the recording process for techno or electronic music in general.
    Hour-long masterpieces can be created from a desk chair with nothing but a
    laptop and a MIDI keyboard.  This makes the process extremely comfortable
    accessible to artists from all different types of backgrounds and environments.
    This also simplifies the often complicated process of project sharing or long-
    distance collaboration.</div>
